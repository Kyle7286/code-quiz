## About/Purpose ‚ùî
---

The purpose of this webpage assignment was to create a timed quiz game in which subtracts time for incorrect answers and stores your initials and score to local storage. This quiz was designed to take in a dynamic amount of questions and run thru each.  The question order is randomly generated and the answers are shuffled so you cannot memorize where each correct answer is.

    * In other words, the more complex your datastructure is, the more complex code you can write
* Learned the imporance of TAKING BREAKS when you are stumped; sometimes a fresh mind will allow you to progress...
* Learned how to add event listener to a class of buttons
